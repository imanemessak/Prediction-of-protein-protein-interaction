We recently showed that in the case of protein NS1 of Zika virus, electrostatics properties play a significant role in the fine changes between strains and how these changes may impact the recognition by antibody used for diagnosis purpose. 
Since electrostatic properties are long-range interactions, to which extent they influence the recognition needs to be addressed.
The present project aims to check if indeed, residues further from the interface would play a role in the recognition process. The project will be based of the recent paper deposited in BioRXiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/759498v2.full by Akbar R et al. 2019). Starting from the data presented in the paper, the project will consist in 
1-        Reevaluating the results using a different criterion for defining the interface, i.e. changes in accessibility rather than cutoff distance. Rim (partially solvent accessible) and Core (totally buried) will be distinguished for the analyses. 
2-        To check the depth of the influence, different distance thresholds from a given site, will be tested and neighboring titratable residues will be quantified. Multiple sequence alignments and co-evolution analysis will be conducted to evaluate the role of these additional electrostatics properties to preserve or on contrary to modify the recognition.
